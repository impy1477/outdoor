ANIMATION FEATURES :

animation time function; erase-in;
animation-delay: 3s;
animationiteratioan-count: 3;
backface-visibility: hidden;
rotate: (180deg);
animation-fill-mode: backwards;
*/

/*
NOTES :

1- z-index is using to put the white background behinde the button
i think the defualt property is 1
so we pick -1 to make sure that the white thing stay behind the button
for this to work we set positon for parent relative and for the child absulote (SECTION 2 LAST VIDEO);

2- to make things invisible we put opacity: 0;

3- animation: animation-name animation-duratiaon animation-time-function animation-delay;

4- for making animation-delay working correctly we set animation-fill-mode: backwards;

5- clearfix {
    content:'';
    clear: both;
    display: table;
} we can use this as well :  className::after {
                                            (clearfixVars)
                                        }
